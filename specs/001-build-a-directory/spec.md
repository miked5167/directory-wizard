# Feature Specification: Directory Creation Wizard

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-directory`
**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a Directory Creation Wizard for a multi-tenant directory kernel. The wizard should allow a platform admin to create a new tenant (directory site) by entering the site name, domain, logo, colors, and fonts, then uploading categories (JSON) and listings (CSV). The wizard must generate a tenant pack (tenant.json, theme.json, categories.json, seed.csv, and optional MDX pages/media) and provision a fully functional tenant site powered by the kernel. The wizard should also provide a preview mode, a draft/publish flow, and the ability to update existing tenants (branding, categories, listings) via re-import. All provisioning actions must integrate with Supabase (for tenant + listing storage), Typesense (for search indexing), Stripe (for subscription/ads), and Vercel (for domain mapping). The goal is to let a non-technical user spin up or adjust a directory without touching JSON or CLI."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature description provided 
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: platform admin, end users
   ’ Actions: create tenant, upload content, provision site, preview, publish
   ’ Data: site config, branding, categories, listings
   ’ Constraints: non-technical user friendly, multi-tenant
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ User flow: admin creates/manages tenant sites 
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable 
6. Identify Key Entities (data involved) 
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Check for implementation details and ambiguities
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A platform administrator needs to create and manage multiple directory websites for different clients/tenants. They want to set up a new directory site by providing basic information (name, domain, branding), uploading content (categories and listings), and having the system automatically generate a fully functional directory website without requiring technical knowledge.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an admin is creating a new tenant site, **When** they enter site name, domain, upload logo and set colors/fonts, **Then** the system generates the basic tenant configuration
2. **Given** an admin has uploaded categories JSON and listings CSV, **When** they trigger site generation, **Then** the system creates a complete tenant package with all required files
3. **Given** a tenant site is in draft mode, **When** the admin uses preview mode, **Then** they can see how the site will look before publishing
4. **Given** an existing tenant needs updates, **When** the admin re-imports new categories or listings, **Then** the site is updated while preserving existing configuration
5. **Given** a tenant site is ready, **When** the admin publishes it, **Then** the site becomes live with proper domain mapping and all integrations active

### Edge Cases
- What happens when uploaded files have invalid formats or missing required fields?
- How does the system handle domain conflicts or invalid domain names?
- What occurs when external service integrations (Supabase, Typesense, Stripe, Vercel) fail during provisioning?
- How are partial uploads or interrupted wizard sessions handled?
- What happens when trying to update a tenant that doesn't exist?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow platform admins to create new tenant sites through a guided wizard interface
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept tenant basic information including site name, domain, logo upload, brand colors, and font selections
- **FR-003**: System MUST support uploading categories data in JSON format and listings data in CSV format
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate a complete tenant package containing tenant.json, theme.json, categories.json, seed.csv, and optional MDX pages/media
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a preview mode allowing admins to see the tenant site before publishing
- **FR-006**: System MUST implement a draft/publish workflow where sites can be prepared and then made live
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow updating existing tenants by re-importing branding, categories, or listings data
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate uploaded files for correct format and required fields before processing
- **FR-009**: System MUST provision tenant data storage, search indexing, payment processing, and domain mapping for each tenant
- **FR-010**: System MUST ensure each tenant site is fully functional upon publication
- **FR-011**: System MUST prevent conflicts between tenant domains and validate domain availability
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide clear error messages and recovery options when uploads or provisioning fail
- **FR-013**: Users MUST be able to save wizard progress and return to complete setup later
- **FR-014**: System MUST maintain audit logs of all tenant creation and modification actions
- **FR-015**: System MUST handle file uploads with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum file size limits not specified]
- **FR-016**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: number of concurrent tenant creations not specified]
- **FR-017**: System MUST authenticate platform admins via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: authentication method not specified]
- **FR-018**: System MUST define access permissions for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: different admin roles or single admin type not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Tenant**: Represents a directory site with unique domain, branding configuration, content categories, and listings data
- **Tenant Package**: Collection of generated files (tenant.json, theme.json, categories.json, seed.csv, MDX pages) that define a complete tenant site
- **Category**: Organizational structure for directory listings with hierarchical relationships and metadata
- **Listing**: Individual directory entries with associated data fields, search attributes, and tenant association
- **Admin Session**: Wizard progress state including uploaded files, configuration choices, and draft status
- **Provisioning Job**: Background process that handles external service integration and site deployment
